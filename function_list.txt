List to track all created functions. Use format "Function Name(arguments): Function Description"
(if anyone has a better way to format this go ahead and change it thats just the first thing I thought of)

Example:
CtoF(double temp): Function to take in a celcius temperature and return the temperature converted to fahrenheit
