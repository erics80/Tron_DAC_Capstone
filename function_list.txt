List to track all created functions. Use format "Function_Type Function_Name(arguments): Function Description"
(if anyone has a better way to format this go ahead and change it thats just the first thing I thought of)
(if you think of a good function but don't know how to make it in code still write it down in this list and can go back to it later or can try
to figure it out as a group)

Example:
int CtoF(double temp): Function to take in a celcius temperature and return the temperature converted to fahrenheit
